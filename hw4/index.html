		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we built a cloth simulator from scratch. First, we built the cloth itself with various spring types to simulate how the cloth pulls on itself. Following that, we transition to seeing the cloth in motion to see the springs actively at work, playing around with the different constants in the process. We modified the spring constant, density constant, and damping constant to get a better understanding of the cloth we build. Then we handled the cloth's interations with other objects as well as itself in the form of collisions. It is super cool to play the animation and see the cloth fall naturally just like in real life! Lastly, to put everything together, we build shaders for the cloth so it can take on different appearances, whether it be reflective, matte, or even a picture of the campanile!

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>

		<p>Here is a screenshot of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe, showing the structure of the point masses and springs.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

		<p>Here is what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		For this part, after I coded it, I experimented around with some parameters of the simulation to further understand it.

		<p>When changing the spring constant ks, I noticed that the cloth fell almost like a piece of paper at 50000 N/m, and more fluidly and softer at 50 N/m. While I'm unable to capture this in a video, here is the hanging result of the two different spring constants, showing the difference in "hardness" of the cloth. This is because the ks determines how strongly the springs try to return to their original position. So, when the value is high, the shape of the cloth more closely resembles its original shape; vice versa, when the value is low, the shape of the cloth strays farther from its original shape and becomes more bendy, since it has less strength to return to its original shape and falls more victim to gravity.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2-50.png" width="500px"/>
				  <figcaption>ks = 50 N/m</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2-50000.png" width="500px"/>
				  <figcaption>ks = 50000 N/m</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>When messing with the density constant. I found the results to be pretty intuitive so I will be brief about what I found. Essentially, the cloth just seemed lighter with a low density constant and heavier with a high density constant. When it is lighter, it fell slower and floated more. When it is heavier, it fell faster and sagged more between the two pin points.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2denslow.png" width="500px"/>
				  <figcaption>density = 1 g/cm^2</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2denshigh.png" width="500px"/>
				  <figcaption>density = 500 g/cm^2</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>Lastly, when messing with the damping constant, I noticed the most change in the movement of the cloth. It fell slower at a higher damping constant and faster at a lower damping constant. I will not include a visual for this part since it is quite intuitive and also cannot easily be represented by a simple screenshot. So just picture a flowy cloth (high damping) versus a heavier cloth that doesn't bounce (low damping).</p>

		<p>Here are some screenshots of the shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! The two screenshots are from slightly different angles to give a better idea of what the cloth looks like.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2shaded1.png" width="500px"/>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt2shaded2.png" width="500px"/>

			  </tr>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>In this simulation, collision handling for both planes and spheres ensures that point masses respond realistically when they intersect with these objects. For planes, a collision is detected when a point mass crosses from one side of the plane to the other between time steps, determined by the change in sign of the dot product between the point's position (relative to the plane) and the plane's normal. When a collision is detected, the simulation computes the tangent point—where the point mass would have intersected the plane if it had traveled in a straight line—and adjusts its position to lie slightly above this point on the original side, using a small SURFACE_OFFSET and applying friction to simulate energy loss. For spheres, a collision is detected if the current position of a point mass lies within the sphere's radius. The point is then pushed outward along the vector from the sphere's center to the point mass, placing it exactly on the sphere's surface, and the displacement is scaled down by a friction factor. </p>
		<p>Here are some screenshots of the shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. I noticed that the smaller the spring constant, the softer the cloth is so the more snugly it wrapped the sphere.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		To handle self-collisions, I first create a hash table to be able to quickly search for which PointMass objects need to be checked during the collisions. Then during the process of the collisions, we use the spacial map to get the nearby point masses. For each point mass, we first make sure it is not itself (that would cause some pretty weird behavior..) then compute the distance between the current point mass and the one we are looking at. If they are closer than 2 * thickness distance apart, we apply a repulsion force to move them apart.

		<p>Here are 3 screenshots that document how the cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="pt4-3.png" width="350px"/>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>Here, I vary the density as well as ks and observe how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</p>

				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>At high density, the cloth falls faster and folds more in the process.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>

				  <img src="pt4lowks.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>With a low spring constant, the cloth is a lot more wrinkley.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="pt4highks.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>With high spring constant, the cloth tries harder to spring back into its original, flat shape.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		A shader program includes a vertex shader, which processes each vertex's position and passes data like normals or texture coordinates, and a fragment shader, which calculates the color of each pixel using lighting, textures, and material properties. When they work together, they are able to create lighting and material effects.

		<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model simulates how the light interacts with a surface to produce realistic lighting. It breaks the lighting down to ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.</p>
